## What to do
You are given a project that is lacks maintainability and is not really easy to test, it's up to you to change the code base so 
that it's easier to test, to maintain and it's general nicer to work with.

The focus will be on the `ViewModel` and the `data` package. 

You can use any testing library, framework etc you want in order to achieve your goal. We like to see what you know :). 

## Constraints
### Time
Don't spend more than 2 hours on this assignment, keep it fun :). 

### Logic
How you test it is up to you, as long as the general business rules stay the same. 

## Done?
Package the project via Android Studio (File -> Export -> Export to zip file) and send it back to the hiring manager. 


Good luck!
